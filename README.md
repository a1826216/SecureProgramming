## Setup Instructions

Python libraries can be installed using pip:

```
pip install websockets
pip install aioconsole
pip install pycryptodome
```

## Running the Client and Server
As the client is a Python file, no compilation is necessary, and it can be started directly.

```
cd client
python3 client.py
```

The server can be started using the same process.

```
cd server
python3 server.py
```
